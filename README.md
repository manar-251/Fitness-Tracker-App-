📖 Description

Workout Tracker is a CRUD web application built with the MEN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) and EJS templates for server-side rendering.

With this app, users can:

Sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts

Add, edit, and delete workout entries

Upload progress photos and tag workouts

Search and filter workouts by date, type, or notes

Track streaks and view detailed statistics with charts

✨ I built this project to make it easier to log daily workouts, visualize progress, and stay motivated through activity streaks and analytics.
